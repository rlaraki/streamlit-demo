    "# Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to write code and execute the code. Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for the human user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`, or automatically execute the code. Depending on the setting of `human_input_mode` and `max_consecutive_auto_reply`, the `UserProxyAgent` either solicits feedback from the human user or returns auto-feedback based on the result of code execution (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`. `AssistantAgent` will debug the code and suggest new code if the result contains error. The two agents keep communicating to each other until the task is done.\n",

    "In the example below, let's see how to use the agents in AutoGen to write a python script and execute the script. This process involves constructing a `AssistantAgent` to serve as the assistant, along with a `UserProxyAgent` that acts as a proxy for the human user. In this example demonstrated below, when constructing the `UserProxyAgent`,  we select the `human_input_mode` to \"NEVER\". This means that the `UserProxyAgent` will not solicit feedback from the human user. It stops replying when the limit defined by `max_consecutive_auto_reply` is reached, or when `is_termination_msg()` returns true for the received message."

We will need to get the stock price at the start of the year and the current stock price, then calculate the percentage change.\\n\\nHowever, as an AI, I\\'m unable to execute real-time web requests or access financial data APIs. I suggest you use the `yfinance` library in Python to download the stock data. Here is an example of how you can do it:\\n\\n```python\\nimport yfinance as yf\\n\\n# Download stock data\\nmeta_data = yf.download(\\'META\\', start=\\'2022-01-01\\', end=current_date)\\ntesla_data = yf.download(\\'TSLA\\', start=\\'2022-01-01\\', end=current_date)\\n\\n# Calculate YTD gain\\nmeta_ytd_gain = ((meta_data[\\'Close\\'][-1] - meta_data[\\'Close\\'][0]) / meta_data[\\'Close\\'][0]) * 100\\ntesla_ytd_gain = ((tesla_data[\\'Close\\'][-1] - tesla_data[\\'Close\\'][0]) / tesla_data[\\'Close\\'][0]) * 100\\n\\nprint(\"META YTD gain: \", meta_ytd_gain)\\nprint(\"TESLA YTD gain: \", tesla_ytd_gain)\\n```\\n\\nPlease note that you need to install the `yfinance` library before running the above code. You can install it using pip:\\n\\n```shell\\npip install yfinance\\n```\\n\\nPlease replace `current_date` in the above code with the actual date you got from the first code block.', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'exitcode: 1 (execution failed)\\nCode output: Today\\'s date is: 2024-05-28\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"/Users/rayanelaraki/Desktop/Demo AI LEAD/coding/tmp_code_53c2842b31395f71a5999811a745ca3f.py\", line 4, in <module>\\n    meta_data = yf.download(\\'META\\', start=\\'2022-01-01\\', end=current_date)\\n                                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNameError: name \\'current_date\\' is not defined\\n', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'I apologize for the confusion.

      "From the data analyzed, the average stock price for META during this period was approximately $389.66, while TESLA's average stock price was around $222.04. This indicates that, on average, META's stock price was higher than TESLA's during this period.\n",

      "While META's stock price shows a general upward trend, TESLA's stock price appears to be more volatile, with significant peaks and troughs. \n",

    "\n",
    "META, the social media giant, had an average stock price of 403.53 during this period. The highest it reached was 519.83, while the lowest was 344.47. The standard deviation, a measure of how spread out the prices were, was 100.72.\n",

    "On the other hand, TESLA, the electric vehicle and clean energy company, had an average stock price of 219.54. The stock reached a high of 248.42 and a low of 171.76. The standard deviation for TESLA was 41.68.\n",
